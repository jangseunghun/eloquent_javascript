machines. Computers themselves can only do stupidly straightforward
things. The reason they are so useful is that they do these things at
an incredibly high speed. A program can, by ingeniously combining many
of these simple actions, do very complicated things.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p215129e5" name="p215129e5"> ¶ </a>To some of us, writing computer programs is a fascinating game. A
program is a building of thought. It is costless to build, weightless,
growing easily under our typing hands. If we get carried away, its
size and complexity will grow out of control, confusing even the one
who created it. This is the main problem of programming. It is why so
much of today's software tends to crash, fail, screw up.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p2a20af99" name="p2a20af99"> ¶ </a>When a program works, it is beautiful. The art of programming is the
skill of controlling complexity. The great program is subdued, made
simple in its complexity.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p24e3f9e3" name="p24e3f9e3"> ¶ </a>Today, many programmers believe that this complexity is best managed
by using only a small set of well-understood techniques in their
programs. They have composed strict rules about the form programs
should have, and the more zealous among them will denounce those who
break these rules as <em>bad</em> programmers.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p48cb88dd" name="p48cb88dd"> ¶ </a>What hostility to the richness of programming! To try to reduce it to
something straightforward and predictable, to place a taboo on all the
weird and beautiful programs. The landscape of programming techniques
is enormous, fascinating in its diversity, still largely unexplored.
It is certainly littered with traps and snares, luring the
inexperienced programmer into all kinds of horrible mistakes, but that
only means you should proceed with caution, keep your wits about you.
As you learn, there will always be new challenges, new territory to
explore. The programmer who refuses to keep exploring will surely
stagnate, forget his joy, lose the will to program (and become a
manager).</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p2ba8b9bb" name="p2ba8b9bb"> ¶ </a>As far as I am concerned, the definite criterion for a program is
whether it is correct. Efficiency, clarity, and size are also
important, but how to balance these against each other is always a
matter of judgement, a judgement that each programmer must make for
himself. Rules of thumb are useful, but one should never be afraid to
break them.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p3fcf291" name="p3fcf291"> ¶ </a>In the beginning, at the birth of computing, there were no programming
languages. Programs looked something like this:</p><pre class="preformatted">00110001 00000000 00000000
00110001 00000001 00000001
00110011 00000001 00000010
01010001 00001011 00000010
00100010 00000010 00001000
01000011 00000001 00000000
01000001 00000001 00000001
00010000 00000010 00000000
01100010 00000000 00000000</pre><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p2eba4016" name="p2eba4016"> ¶ </a>That is a program to add the numbers from one to ten together, and
print out the result (1 + 2 + ... + 10 = 55). It could run on a very
simple kind of computer. To program early computers, it was necessary
to set large arrays of switches in the right position, or punch holes
in strips of cardboard and feed them to the computer. You can imagine
how this was a tedious, error-prone procedure. Even the writing of
simple programs required much cleverness and discipline, complex ones
were nearly inconceivable.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#pa244d1d" name="pa244d1d"> ¶ </a>Of course, manually entering these arcane patterns of bits (which is
what the 1s and 0s above are generally called) did give the programmer
a profound sense of being a mighty wizard. And that has to be worth
something, in terms of job satisfaction.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p4232880f" name="p4232880f"> ¶ </a>Each line of the program contains a single instruction. It could be
written in English like this:</p><ol><li>Store the number 0 in memory location 0</li><li>Store the number 1 in memory location 1</li><li>Store the value of memory location 1 in memory location 2</li><li>Decrement the value in memory location 2 by the number 11</li><li>If the value in memory location 2 is the number 0, continue with instruction 9</li><li>Increment the value in memory location 0 by the value in memory location 1</li><li>Increment the value in memory location 1 by the number 1</li><li>Continue with instruction 3</li><li>Output the value of memory location 0</li></ol><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p376bdd6c" name="p376bdd6c"> ¶ </a>While that is more readable than the binary soup, it is still rather
unpleasant. It might help to use names instead of numbers for the
instructions and memory locations:</p><pre class="preformatted"> Set 'total' to 0
 Set 'count' to 1
[loop]
 Set 'compare' to 'count'
 Subtract 11 from 'compare'
 If 'compare' is zero, continue at [end]
 Add 'count' to 'total'
 Add 1 to 'count'
 Continue at [loop]
[end]
 Output 'total'</pre><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p6c15459b" name="p6c15459b"> ¶ </a>At this point it is not too hard to see how the program works. Can
you? The first two lines give two memory locations their starting
values: <code>total</code> will be used to build up the result of the program,
and <code>count</code> keeps track of the number that we are currently looking
at. The lines using <code>compare</code> are probably the weirdest ones. What the
program wants to do is see if <code>count</code> is equal to 11, in order to
decide whether it can stop yet. Because the machine is so primitive,
it can only test whether a number is zero, and make a decision (jump)
based on that. So it uses the memory location labelled <code>compare</code> to
compute the value of <code>count - 11</code>, and makes a decision based on that
value. The next two lines add the value of <code>count</code> to the result, and
increment <code>count</code> by one every time the program has decided that it is
not 11 yet.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p1ab25ae7" name="p1ab25ae7"> ¶ </a>Here is the same program in JavaScript:</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">total</span> = <span class="atom">0</span>, <span class="variable">count</span> = <span class="atom">1</span>;
<span class="keyword">while</span> (<span class="variable">count</span> &lt;= <span class="atom">10</span>) {
  <span class="variable">total</span> += <span class="variable">count</span>;
  <span class="variable">count</span> += <span class="atom">1</span>;
}
<span class="variable">print</span>(<span class="variable">total</span>);</pre><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p65172146" name="p65172146"> ¶ </a>This gives us a few more improvements. Most importantly, there is no
need to specify the way we want the program to jump back and forth
anymore. The magic word <code>while</code> takes care of that. It continues
executing the lines below it as long as the condition it was given
holds: <code>count &lt;= 10</code>, which means '<code>count</code> is less than or equal
to <code>10</code>'. Apparently, there is no need anymore to create a temporary
value and compare that to zero. This was a stupid little detail, and
the power of programming languages is that they take care of stupid
little details for us.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p6ceceb6e" name="p6ceceb6e"> ¶ </a>Finally, here is what the program could look like if we happened to
have the convenient operations <code>range</code> and <code>sum</code> available, which
respectively create a collection of numbers within a range and compute
the sum of a collection of numbers:</p><pre class="code"><span class="variable">print</span>(<span class="variable">sum</span>(<span class="variable">range</span>(<span class="atom">1</span>, <span class="atom">10</span>)));</pre><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p52ee2d" name="p52ee2d"> ¶ </a>The moral of this story, then, is that the same program can be
expressed in long and short, unreadable and readable ways. The first
version of the program was extremely obscure, while this last one is
almost English: <code>print</code> the <code>sum</code> of the <code>range</code> of numbers from <code>1</code>
to <code>10</code>. (We will see in later chapters how to build things like <code>sum</code>
and <code>range</code>.)</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p4c3f6ccc" name="p4c3f6ccc"> ¶ </a>A good programming language helps the programmer by providing a more
abstract way to express himself. It hides uninteresting details,
provides convenient building blocks (such as the <code>while</code> construct),
and, most of the time, allows the programmer to add building blocks
himself (such as the <code>sum</code> and <code>range</code> operations).</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p1d7306d6" name="p1d7306d6"> ¶ </a>JavaScript is the language that is, at the moment, mostly being used
to do all kinds of clever and horrible things with pages on the World
Wide Web. Some <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/02/next-big-language.html">people</a> claim
that the next version of JavaScript will become an important language
for other tasks too. I am unsure whether that will happen, but if you
are interested in programming, JavaScript is definitely a useful
language to learn. Even if you do not end up doing much
web programming, the mind-bending programs I will show you in this
book will always stay with you, haunt you, and influence the programs
you write in other languages.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#pb848901" name="pb848901"> ¶ </a>There are those who will say <em>terrible</em> things about JavaScript. Many
of these things are true. When I was for the first time required to
write something in JavaScript, I quickly came to despise the language.
It would accept almost anything I typed, but interpret it in a way
that was completely different from what I meant. This had a lot to do
with the fact that I did not have a clue what I was doing, but there
is also a real issue here: JavaScript is ridiculously liberal in what
it allows. The idea behind this design was that it would make
programming in JavaScript easier for beginners. In actuality, it
mostly makes finding problems in your programs harder, because the
system will not point them out to you.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p1d6fd4ed" name="p1d6fd4ed"> ¶ </a>However, the flexibility of the language is also an advantage. It
leaves space for a lot of techniques that are impossible in more rigid
languages, and it can be used to overcome some of JavaScript's
shortcomings. After learning it properly, and working with it for a
while, I have really learned to <em>like</em> this language.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p466674a7" name="p466674a7"> ¶ </a>Contrary to what the name suggests, JavaScript has very little to do
with the programming language named Java. The similar name was
inspired by marketing considerations, rather than good judgement. In
1995, when JavaScript was introduced by Netscape, the Java language
was being heavily marketed and gaining in popularity. Apparently,
someone thought it a good idea to try and ride along on this
marketing. Now we are stuck with the name.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p3da669a5" name="p3da669a5"> ¶ </a>Related to JavaScript is a thing called ECMAScript. When browsers
other than Netscape started to support JavaScript, or something that
looked like it, a document was written to describe precisely how the
language should work. The language described in this document is
called ECMAScript, after the organisation that standardised it.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p505fc477" name="p505fc477"> ¶ </a>ECMAScript describes a general-purpose programming language, and does
not say anything about the integration of this language in an Internet
browser. JavaScript is ECMAScript plus extra tools for dealing with
Internet pages and browser windows.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p9e425af" name="p9e425af"> ¶ </a>A few other pieces of software use the language described in the
ECMAScript document. Most importantly, the ActionScript language used
by Flash is based on ECMAScript (though it does not precisely follow
the standard). Flash is a system for adding things that move and make
lots of noise to web-pages. Knowing JavaScript won't hurt if you ever
find yourself learning to build Flash movies.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p3de32070" name="p3de32070"> ¶ </a>JavaScript is still evolving. Since this book came out, ECMAScript 5
has been released, which is compatible with the version described
here, but adds some of the functionality we will be writing ourselves
as built-in methods. The newest generation of browsers provides this
expanded version of JavaScript. As of 2011, 'ECMAScript harmony', a
more radical extension of the language, is in the process of being
standardised. You should not worry too much about these new versions
making the things you learn from this book obsolete. For one thing,
they will be an extension of the language we have now, so almost
everything written in this book will still hold.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p1aab2232" name="p1aab2232"> ¶ </a>Most chapters in this book contain quite a lot of code<a class="footref" href="#footnote1">1</a>. In my
experience, reading and writing code is an important part of learning
to program. Try to not just glance over these examples, but read them
attentively and understand them. This can be slow and confusing at
first, but you will quickly get the hang of it. The same goes for the
exercises. Don't assume you understand them until you've actually
written a working solution.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p74d44c85" name="p74d44c85"> ¶ </a>Because of the way the web works, it is always possible to look at the
JavaScript programs that people put in their web-pages. This can be a
good way to learn how some things are done. Because most web
programmers are not 'professional' programmers, or consider JavaScript
programming so uninteresting that they never properly learned it, a
lot of the code you can find like this is of a <em>very</em> bad quality.
When learning from ugly or incorrect code, the ugliness and confusion
will propagate into your own code, so be careful who you learn from.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p2906fda8" name="p2906fda8"> ¶ </a>To allow you to try out programs, both the examples and the code you
write yourself, this book makes use of something called a <a name="key2"></a>console.
If you are using a modern graphical browser (Internet Explorer version
6 or higher, Firefox 1.5 or higher, Opera 9 or higher, Safari 3 or
higher, Chrome), the pages in this book will show a blueish bar at the
bottom of your screen. You can open the console by clicking on the
little arrow on the far right of this bar. (Note that I am not talking
about your browser's built-in console.)</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p7303f6ba" name="p7303f6ba"> ¶ </a>The console contains three important elements. There is the output
window, which is used to show error messages and things that programs
print out. Below that, there is a line where you can type in a piece
of JavaScript. Try typing in a number, and pressing the enter key to
run what you typed. If the text you typed produced something
meaningful, it will be shown in the output window. Now try typing
<code>wrong!</code>, and press enter again. The output window will show an error
message. You can use the arrow-up and arrow-down keys to go back to
previous commands that you typed.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p513e6d64" name="p513e6d64"> ¶ </a>For bigger pieces of code, those that span multiple lines and which
you want to keep around for a while, the field on the right can be
used. The 'Run' button is used to execute programs written in this
field. It is possible to have multiple programs open at the same time.
Use the 'New' button to open a new, empty buffer. When there is more
than one open buffer, the menu next to the 'Run' button can be used to
choose which one is being shown. The 'Close' button, as you might
expect, closes a buffer.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p7fc41d6e" name="p7fc41d6e"> ¶ </a>Example programs in this book always have a small button with an arrow
in their top-right corner, which can be used to run them. The example
we saw earlier looked like this:</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">total</span> = <span class="atom">0</span>, <span class="variable">count</span> = <span class="atom">1</span>;
<span class="keyword">while</span> (<span class="variable">count</span> &lt;= <span class="atom">10</span>) {
  <span class="variable">total</span> += <span class="variable">count</span>;
  <span class="variable">count</span> += <span class="atom">1</span>;
}
<span class="variable">print</span>(<span class="variable">total</span>);</pre><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p18d21579" name="p18d21579"> ¶ </a>Run it by clicking the arrow. There is also another button, which is
used to load the program into the console. Do not hesitate to modify
it and try out the result. The worst that could happen is that you
create an endless loop. An endless loop is what you get when the
condition of the <code>while</code> never becomes false, for example if you
choose to add <code>0</code> instead of <code>1</code> to the count variable. Now the
program will run forever.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p640328a9" name="p640328a9"> ¶ </a>Fortunately, browsers keep an eye on the programs running inside them.
Whenever one of them is taking suspiciously long to finish, they will
ask you if you want to cut it off.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p5b6fd1ae" name="p5b6fd1ae"> ¶ </a>In some later chapters, we will build example programs that consist of
many blocks of code. Often, you have to run every one of them for the
program to work. As you may have noticed, the arrow in a block of code
turns purple after the block has been run. When reading a chapter, try
to run every block of code you come across, especially those that
'define' something new (you will see what that means in the next
chapter).</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p784d1b5a" name="p784d1b5a"> ¶ </a>It is, of course, possible that you can not read a chapter in one
sitting. This means you will have to start halfway when you continue
reading, but if you don't run all the code starting from the top of
the chapter, some things might not work. By holding the shift key
while pressing the 'run' arrow on a block of code, all blocks before
that one will be run as well, so when you start in the middle of a
chapter, hold shift the first time you run a piece of code, and
everything should work as expected.</p></div><ol class="footnotes"><li><a name="footnote1"></a>'Code' is the substance that programs are made of. Every piece of a
